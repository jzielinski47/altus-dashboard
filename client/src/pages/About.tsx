        Altus is a fully functional dashboard that embodies my long-standing vision of a clean and intuitive web
        application. For several years, I aspired to create such a project but lacked the time while working as a
        barista at Krakow International Airport. By the last quarter of 2024, I successfully delivered it in its Minimum
        Viable Product (MVP) state. The app steadily progressed as I developed it alongside my primary university tasks,
        working on it in my spare time, driven by a passion to create something unique and truly my own in a field I was
        deeply passionate about. Inspired by the quote Non omnis moriar, Altus stands as a reflection of my journey and
        growth as a web developer.
