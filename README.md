# Avantgarde Project
Avantgarde Project is a fully functional web application that blends usability with elegance. The primary goal is to bring together various innovative ideas into a single platform, prioritizing user experience over visual design in the initial stages. While the focus is currently on delivering a seamless and intuitive product, aesthetics are not neglected; my background as a graphic designer plays a significant role in shaping the app's overall look and feel. Ultimately, the aim is to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly dashboard that embodies my vision.

REST API infrastructure:

`POST /api/auth/signup`: Register new users.
`POST /api/auth/`: User authentication and login.
`GET /api/auth/status`: Check the current authentication status of a user.
`GET /api/users`: Retrieve user information.
`GET /api/admin`: Admin-specific endpoints for managing user roles and permissions.
This version emphasizes the project's vision and functionality and highlights the balance between practicality and design.

Currently working on the REST API. 
As I finish working with the REST API, I'm about to develop a fully functional dashboard up to the end.
