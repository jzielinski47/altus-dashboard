# Avantgarde Project

Avantgarde Project is a fully functional web app, consolidating usability with elegance. - Core Concept for now

The idea for the project was to use the things I've learned over the last couple of years and merge them into a single major project since I've never completed one from scratch to the end. I start with a quite simple backend, as the project will slowly grow and gain more stuff as time goes on.
